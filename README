My cell phone provider will gateway SMS messages to email and back
again.  This is a library for writing services that run on my computer
that can be accessed by SMS.

For example, my phone's alarm function is clumsy and unreliable.  So I
have a service that receives an SMS requesting an alarm, and which
delivers another SMS to the phone at the requested time.  Well,
actually I haven't written that one yet.

bin/license-plate is an example of a working service.
bin/how-old is an incomplete service.
