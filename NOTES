There should be a filter program

        phone-service command args...

the job of phone-service is simple to interface to the mail system.
it will read an email message from stdin, discard the headers (except
for the subject, possibly) and send it to the command.  The command is
a simple filter.  phone-service will receive the command's stdout and
route it back to the mail system.

There will also be a dispatcher program

        phone-dispatch [ -f config ]

which reads the message subject and the config file and then passes
the message to some command as specified in the config file, which has
a bunch of patterns for the subject to match.  Typically the commands
in the config file will be invocations of phone-service.

Add logging to dispatcher application!
